    <string name="about_navy">In the 22 years I served my favorite job was teaching at the Naval
        Academy.  It was a great time and I really enjoyed teaching and got to be in command of my
        own training craft, Yard Patrol craft 692 which was used to teach midshipmen navigation,
        ship handling and watch standing.</string>
    <string name="about_me">I am a retired Navy Chief Petty Officer from Corpus and I graduated
        from FBHS a very long time ago.  I live in Port Aransas with my dog Tequila and I paint
        miniatures and read for relaxation. </string>
    <string name="about_dog">Tequila is a 19 year old dapple Dachshund dog.  He is a very good
        doggie and he likes to sleep and eat and he is very good at both.  He is
        also very good at barking at people and other dogs.  He\'s my best buddy.</string>
